Granicus Branding Repository
========
This repo will serve as a collection of active assets used by Granicus.
When assets are updated we will push this repository to an AWS instance.
The file structure and naming conventions will be focused on logic and speed.
This will make the assets availble for linking from a common permalink structure.
This will help to streamline our branding asset pipeline and ensure a consistent brand acorss all our products.
